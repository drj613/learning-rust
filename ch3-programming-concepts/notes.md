## Variables and Mutability

- Variables are immutable by default.

To make a variable mutable, add `mut` to its initialization, like so:

```rust
fn main(){
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is {}", x);
    x = 6
    println!("The value of x is {}", x);
}
```

`=> The value of x is 5`
`=> The value of x is 6`

### Variables vs Constants

- Constants aren't just immutable by default, they are _always_ immutable

- Declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword

- You _must_ declare the type of the value for constants (e.g. `const VALUE: u32 = 168`)

- Constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime

- Rust's naming convention for constants it to use all UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES between words. Underscores can also be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability:

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

- Naming hardcoded values used throughout a program as constants is useful in converying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code

### Shadowing

> You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new variable will shadow the previous variable. The first variable is _shadowed_ by the second. When the variable is called, the value of the most recent shadow will be used


```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;
    // x = 5 + 1
    let x = x * 2;
    // x = (5 + 1) * 2
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

`=> The value of x is 12`

> Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut`, because we'll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the let keyword
> By using `let`, we can perform transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed
> The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that because we're creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again, we can change the _type_ of the value but reuse the same name.

```rust
let spaces = "    ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

This is allowed because shadowing creates a brand-new variable with the same name rather than changing the value of the `spaces` variable. If we tried to use `mut` for this, as shown here, we'd get a mismatched types error at compile time:

```rust
let mut spaces = "   ";
spaces = spaces.len();
```

> Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with different names, such as `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`; instead we can reuse the simpler `spaces` name.

## Data Types

> Rust is a _statically typed language_, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

Every value in Rust of a certain _data type_, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. We'll look at two subsets of data types: `scalar` and `compound`.

The compiler can usually infer what type we want based on the value and how it's used, but in cases when many types are possible, we must add a type notation, like so:

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

If we don't add the type annotation above, the compiler will display `error[E0282]: type annotation needed`.

### Scalar Types

> A _scalar_ type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

#### Integer Types

- Integers are whole numbers (no fractional/decimal component)


|  Length | Signed | Unsigned |
|:-------:|:------:|:--------:|
| 8-bit   |   i8   |    u8    |
| 16-bit  |   i16  |    u16   |
| 32-bit  |   i32  |    u32   |
| 64-bit  |   i64  |    u64   |
| 128-bit |  i128  |   u128   |
| arch    |  isize |   usize  |

- Each type of integer can either be signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.

- _Signed_ = negative or positive

- _Unsigned_ = all positive

> Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2^n - 1) to 2^n - 1 - 1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from -(2^7) to 2^7 - 1, which equals -128 to 127
> Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 2^8 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.
> Additionally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the kind of computer your program is running on: 64 bits on a 64-bit architecture, and 32 bits on a 32-bit architecture.

If you don't know what kind or size of integer to use, Rust's defaults are a safe bet, and integer types default to `i32` - this type is usually the fastest, even on 64-bit systems. `isize` or `usize` are mainly used when indexing some sort of collection.

If you have a variable of type `u8`, it can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, like 256, **_integer overflow_** will occur. Compiling in debug mode will cause a _panic_ (AKA 'program exits with an error') at runtime if this occurs. Compiling in release mode, Rust instead performs _two's complement wrapping_. Values greater than the max value that the type can hold will loop back around, starting at the lowest value the integer can hold. 

> In the case of a `u8`, 256 becomes 0, 257 becomes 1, and so on.


#### Floating-Point Types

Rust also has two primitive types for _floating-point numbers_ (numbers with decimal points). Rust's floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 and 64 bits in size, respectively.

Rust's float default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs it's roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision.

```rust
fn main(){
    let x = 2.0 // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0 // f32
}
```

`f32` is a single-precision float, `f64` has double precision.


#### Numeric Operations

Rust supports all of the usual mathematical operations you'd expect.

`+`
`-`
`*`
`/`
`%`

#### Booleans

As in most other languages, Booleans in Rust have two possible values: `true`/`false`. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using `bool`. It's usually inferred by the compiler, but can be explicitly annotated like so:

`let f: bool = false;`

#### The Character Type

Rust has a data type specifically for characters: `char`. `char`literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.

```rust
fn main(){
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'Z';
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

Rust's `char` type is four byte in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent foreign languages and accented letters as well as ASCII.

### Compound Types

_Compound types_ can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compount types: tuples and arrays.

#### The Tuple Type
