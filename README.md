# learning-rust

(https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ Source)

Welcome to my Rust-learning repo! Nothing too crazy exciting in here, just a folder for each chapter of the official Rust book as I work my way through it.

Inside of every chapter's folder is a `notes.md` file wherein I will try to abstract the key points of each chapter down. The hope here is that I can: 1) reinforce what I just learned by summarizing; 2) have more concise points than the book when possible so that I can find what I need at a glance; 3) provide the same for anyone else who may stumble upon this repo.
